# Target Operating Model (TOM)  
Privileged Access Management – FinClear (post go-live January 2026)

**Objective**  
Define how CyberArk will be operated day-to-day after the project ends, ensuring security, compliance and business efficiency with clear roles, processes and tools.

**My role as IAM Business Strategic Analyst**  
I designed this future-state operating model during the programme, validated it in two workshops with CISO, Head of Infrastructure, PAM Operations and SOC, and used it for the handover to BAU.

### The 5 Layers of the PAM Operating Model

| Layer | Purpose | Key Tools | Owner | Daily Activities |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| **Level 0 – Governance** | Strategic oversight & policy | Quarterly Governance Board | CISO (chair) | Review KPIs, approve exceptions, roadmap decisions |
| **Level 1 – Request & Approval** | Controlled privileged access | PVWA Self-Service + Dual Control | Business Approvers (Application Owners, Managers) | Submit JIT requests, approve/reject with reason (max 15 min) |
| **Level 2 – Access Delivery** | Secure session delivery | PSM / PSM-SSH / HTML5 Gateway | PAM Operations Team | Session proxy, live monitoring, emergency termination |
| **Level 3 – Credential Management** | Secrets lifecycle | CPM + Platform connectors | PAM Operations Team | Automatic rotation, onboarding new accounts, reconciliation |
| **Level 4 – Monitoring & Response** | Real-time detection | Splunk + CyberArk alerts | SOC Level 2/3 | Alert investigation, session termination, monthly reporting |
| **Level 5 – Identity Integration** | Sync with HR & IGA | SailPoint ↔ CyberArk API, Entra ID | Identity Governance Team | Auto-disable on termination, metadata sync (department, manager) |

### Core Principles
- **Zero Standing Privileges**: No permanent admin rights – everything is Just-In-Time  
- **Least Privilege**: Access exactly what is needed, nothing more  
- **Full Traceability**: Every action recorded and searchable in Splunk  
- **Automation First**: Manual tasks only for exceptions  

### Benefits for FinClear
- Compliance: Full audit trail for ISO 27001, NIS2, DORA, GDPR  
- Risk reduction: Eliminates shared accounts and permanent rights  
- Efficiency: Approvers spend < 15 min/day, PAM team focuses on value-add tasks  
- Scalability: Ready for SCADA full rollout (2026) and future automation
