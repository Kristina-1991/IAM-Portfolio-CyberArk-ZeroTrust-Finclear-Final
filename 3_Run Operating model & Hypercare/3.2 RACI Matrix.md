# RACI Matrix – Privileged Access Management (Run Phase – from Jan 2026)

**Designed & validated by me (IAM Senior Business Analyst)**  
→ Two dedicated workshops (Nov-Dec 2025) with CISO, Head of Infra, SOC Manager, Identity Governance, PAM Ops  
→ Signed-off as official responsibility model on 15 December 2025 (same workshop as TOM)

### RACI Definitions (standard PMI/COBIT)
- **R** = Responsible – does the work  
- **A** = Accountable – ultimately answerable (only one A per row)  
- **C** = Consulted – provides input  
- **I** = Informed – kept in the loop  

### Why this RACI is excellent (what I say in interviews)
- Only **one A per activity** → no ambiguity  
- Business Approvers own the approval → real dual control, not just security  
- SOC owns monitoring & termination → true defence-in-depth  
- Identity Governance owns termination sync → no more leavers with access  
- CISO remains Accountable for everything → strong governance (DORA/NIS2 compliant)

**This RACI is the official responsibility model in production since January 2026.**
