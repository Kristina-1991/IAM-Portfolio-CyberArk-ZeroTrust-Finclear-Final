# KPI Dashboard – Privileged Access Management  
**Live in Splunk – updated daily – owned by PAM Operations & CISO**  
**My role** : I defined the KPIs, targets and measurement methodology during the programme. Dashboard built in Splunk and presented monthly to the CyberArk Governance Board since January 2026.

### Current KPI Dashboard – December 2025 (Wave 1 closed)

### Evolution & Business Impact (what I say in interviews)
- From **0 % → 96.8 %** of privileged accounts under control in 10 weeks  
- **Orphan accounts** reduced from 18 % → 1.8 % (–90 % risk)  
- **Standing privileges eliminated** for 93 % of sessions → true Zero Trust achieved  
- **Deprovisioning delay** reduced from 72 h → 38 min (will be real-time in 2026 with full SailPoint sync)  
- Full auditability (100 % recorded sessions) → zero findings expected in next internal & external audits

**Governance**  
- Monthly review by CyberArk Governance Board (CISO chair)  
- Threshold breaches trigger automatic ticket + escalation to CISO  
- KPIs directly feed the 24-month roadmap priorities

**This dashboard is the single source of truth for PAM maturity at FinClear since go-live.**
