### Key Change Levers That Worked

| Lever                     | Implementation                               | Result                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Business approvers in UAT | 12 real approvers trained during UAT         | Average approval time 11 min (instead of 2 h) |
| “Zero standing privilege” communication | Mandatory video + quiz signed by manager | 100 % completion before go-live             |
| Self-service sandbox      | PVWA sandbox open 2 weeks before go-live     | 87 % of users tested before Day 0           |
| Daily adoption metrics    | Live counter on intranet                     | Created positive peer pressure              |

**Outcome**  
- 94 % of targeted users actively using PVWA self-service by week 4  
- Zero formal complaints / change resistance  
- Change saturation avoided (only 1 major change in Q4 2025)
