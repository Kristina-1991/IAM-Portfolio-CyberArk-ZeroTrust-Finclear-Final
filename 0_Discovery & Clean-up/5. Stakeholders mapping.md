# Stakeholder Mapping & Communication Strategy
Outcome of Discovery & Clean-up phase – BR-00

## Objective
Identify and prioritise all parties impacted by the absence of PAM in order to:
- secure sponsorship and budget,
- collect accurate requirements,
- guarantee adoption of JIT workflows and session recording,
- ensure regulatory alignment (NIS2, DORA, GDPR, ISO 27001).

## Approach (what I actually did as IAM Business Analyst)
1. Reviewed audit findings (150 unmanaged privileged accounts in 2024), incident logs and existing IAM ecosystem  
2. Built initial list from RACI + organisational chart  
3. Ran 3 targeted interviews (CISO sponsor, Head of Cloud, Compliance Officer)  
4. Plotted stakeholders on Power/Interest grid  
5. Validated the final mapping in a 1-hour workshop (sign-off obtained)

## Project Governance Stakeholders (Power/Interest view)

| High Power – High Interest      | High Power – Low Interest |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| CISO (Programme Sponsor)        | CFO / CTO                 |
| Head of IAM / PAM Lead          | Legal & Compliance        |
| Head of Cloud Architecture      |                           |

| Low Power – High Interest       | Low Power – Low Interest  |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| SOC Analysts                    | End-users (only informed) |
| DBAs & Application Owners       |                           |

## Future CyberArk Users & Operators (Run view)

| Stakeholder                | Daily/Weekly Role with CyberArk               | Main Concern                               | Engagement Action                     |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| System / DB Administrator | Onboard accounts, use PSM for servers/DB     | Production impact                          | Dedicated onboarding wave + UAT       |
| Application Owner          | Approve JIT requests for their apps          | Temporary access without permanent rights  | JIT workflow demo                     |
| Manager / Approver         | Approve or reject JIT requests               | Quick approval process                     | PVWA approver training                |
| SOC Analyst                | Monitor sessions & alerts in Splunk          | Alert fatigue                              | Real-time syslog demo                 |
| PAM Administrator         | Configure safes, policies, workflows         | Operational complexity                     | Weekly sync + design authority        |
| Security Auditor / Compliance | Review recordings & reports                 | Regulatory evidence (DORA/NIS2)            | Monthly audit report                  |
| HR / IGA Team              | Separate standard vs privileged identities   | Sync SailPoint ↔ CyberArk                  | Joint workshop                        |

This mapping was built and validated during three workshops and directly feeds the RACI in phase 4.           |

### Communication outcome
- 100 % of High Power stakeholders signed off the scope and BR-01/02/03  
- Dedicated Slack/Teams channel created for the programme  
- Monthly newsletter planned for Low Power – High Interest group
