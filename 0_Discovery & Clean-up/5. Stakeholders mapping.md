# Stakeholder Mapping & Communication Strategy
Outcome of Discovery & Clean-up phase – BR-00

## Objective
Identify and prioritise all parties impacted by the absence of PAM in order to:
- secure sponsorship and budget,
- collect accurate requirements,
- guarantee adoption of JIT workflows and session recording,
- ensure regulatory alignment (NIS2, DORA, GDPR, ISO 27001).

## Approach
1. Reviewed audit findings (150 unmanaged privileged accounts in 2024), incident logs and existing IAM ecosystem  
2. Built initial list from RACI + organisational chart  
3. Ran 3 targeted interviews (CISO sponsor, Head of Cloud, Compliance Officer)  
4. Plotted stakeholders on Power/Interest grid  
5. Validated the final mapping in a 1-hour workshop (sign-off obtained)


## RACI Matrix – Privileged Access Management (Run Phase – from Jan 2026)

**Designed & validated by me (IAM Business Strategic Analyst)**  
→ Two dedicated workshops (Nov-Dec 2025) with CISO, Head of Infra, SOC Manager, Identity Governance, PAM Ops  
→ Signed-off as official responsibility model on 15 December 2025 (same workshop as TOM)

### RACI Definitions (standard PMI/COBIT)
- **R** = Responsible – does the work  
- **A** = Accountable – ultimately answerable (only one A per row)  
- **C** = Consulted – provides input  
- **I** = Informed – kept in the loop  

### Values of this RACI matrix
- Only **one A per activity** → no ambiguity  
- Business Approvers own the approval → real dual control, not just security  
- SOC owns monitoring & termination → true defence-in-depth  
- Identity Governance owns termination sync → no more leavers with access  
- CISO remains Accountable for everything → strong governance (DORA/NIS2 compliant)
