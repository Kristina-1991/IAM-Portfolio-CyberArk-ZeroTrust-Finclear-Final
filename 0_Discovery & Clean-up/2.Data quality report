# Data quality report 

## Objective 
Ensure that data is reliable before onboarding, avoiding importing obsolete accounts into CyberArk.

**Business impact of poor data quality**  

Without this clean-up, FinClear would have imported ~120 obsolete or unjustified accounts into CyberArk, creating immediate audit findings (shared/orphan accounts) and false positives in session monitoring.

## Approach 
From an IAM Business Analyst's perspective, data quality reporting is essential to ensure the reliability of information prior to onboarding into CyberArk. I oversaw this analysis to identify and correct inconsistencies in the AS-IS ecosystem (Workday, Sailpoint, Entra ID, AD, Splunk).

### Data quality rules 

I have defined rules based on standard dimensions (DAMA):

- **Completeness:** All AD accounts must have an EmployeeID linked to Workday (threshold: 95%).
- **Uniqueness:** No duplicates in account or group names (detection via SQL DISTINCT).
- **Validity:** High privileges must be justified by an active department (AD-HR cross-check).
- **Timeliness:** Accounts inactive for >90 days (Splunk logs) marked as orphaned.
- **Consistency:** Alignment between AD and Sailpoint for roles (verification via API).
These rules were applied via SQL scripts joining the Workday and AD databases.

### Metrics 

| Data Quality Dimension | Current Score | Accounts impacted | Link to CyberArk control       | Recommendation                  |
|------------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Completeness           | 92 %          | 68 accounts       | BR-01 – avoid onboarding orphans | Assign owner or disable        |
| Uniqueness             | 98 %          | 17 duplicates     | BR-01 – safe management          | Merge or delete                |
| Validity               | 85 %          | 128 unjustified   | BR-02 – JIT + dual approval      | Remove permanent rights        |
| Timeliness             | 88 %          | 102 inactive >90j | BR-01 + BR-03                    | Quarantine + disable           |
| **Overall score**      | **90.6 / 100**| **~120 accounts to clean** |

### Decision
All 120 accounts identified have been excluded from initial CyberArk onboarding or placed in a dedicated “Quarantine Safe” (Wave 0).  
Clean data set ready for BR-01 semi-automated onboarding (see section 2).
