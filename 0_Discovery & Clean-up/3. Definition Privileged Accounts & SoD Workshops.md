# Definition of Privileged Accounts & SoD Governance Workshops
Outcome of Discovery & Clean-up phase – BR-00

## Objective
Define clear criteria for privileged accounts and apply Segregation of Duties (SoD) to eliminate toxic combinations, thereby prioritising and securing onboarding into CyberArk.

## Approach
As IAM Business Analyst, I facilitated a series of workshops with business stakeholders, application owners, compliance/risk teams and security teams to:
- jointly define what constitutes a privileged account at FinClear,
- build and validate the SoD matrix,
- decide remediation actions (role split, JIT enforcement, safe segregation).

## Definition of a Privileged Account
A privileged account is any account capable of impacting the confidentiality, integrity or availability (CIA triad) of critical FinClear resources. 

*Examples: Domain Admins, root accounts, AWS IAM roles with ∗:∗, service accounts with sysadmin on Azure SQL/Oracle, break-glass accounts.*

Criteria used: rights significantly above standard user, access to sensitive trading data, or potential for privilege escalation.

## Segregation of Duties (SoD) Method
1. Start from the privileged account inventory (850 accounts)  
2. Map each account/role to business functions  
2. Build SoD matrix (roles vs. incompatible functions)  
3. Run 3 validation workshops with stakeholders  
4. Flag conflicts → remediation via CyberArk controls (see below)  

Tools: Excel matrix + SailPoint role repository for future automation.

## SoD Matrix – FinClear (validated in workshops)

| Role / Function         | Approve | Execute | Monitor | Audit | Create | Delete | Modify | Access Sensitive Data | Approve Changes |
|-------------------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| AD Admin                | OK      | Conflict| OK      | Conflict| OK     | Conflict| OK     | Conflict              | Conflict        |
| Application Owner       | Conflict| OK      | OK      | OK    | Conflict| OK     | OK     | OK                    | OK              |
| Contractor              | OK      | OK      | Conflict| OK    | OK     | Conflict| Conflict| Conflict             | Conflict        |
| Database Admin          | Conflict| OK      | OK      | Conflict| OK     | OK     | OK     | Conflict              | Conflict        |
| Network Admin           | OK      | Conflict| OK      | Conflict| Conflict| OK     | OK     | Conflict              | OK              |
| Compliance Officer      | OK      | Conflict| Conflict| OK    | Conflict| Conflict| Conflict| OK                   | OK              |
| Developer               | Conflict| OK      | Conflict| Conflict| OK     | OK     | OK     | Conflict              | Conflict        |
| End User                | Conflict| OK      | Conflict| Conflict| Conflict| Conflict| Conflict| Conflict             | Conflict        |

Legend: OK = authorised 

Conflict = forbidden combination (fraud/error risk)

## Link to CyberArk Foundational Controls
The SoD conflicts identified directly drive three mandatory CyberArk capabilities:
- **BR-02 JIT approval workflow** → dual (or multi-level) approval required for any conflicting function  
- **BR-01 safe segregation** → conflicting roles placed in separate safes with mutually-exclusive membership policies  
- **BR-03 session recording & alerting** → real-time detection and recording of attempted SoD violations

This is a fictional example built for portfolio purposes and based on real-world best practices (NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, DORA requirements).
