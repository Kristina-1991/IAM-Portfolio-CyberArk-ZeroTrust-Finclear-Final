# Use cases & Acceptance criteria 

As the IAM Business Strategic Analyst, I translate each requirement into clear, observable outcomes that define what “done” means for this use case. Acceptance Criteria are **measurable**, **testable**, and **evidence-based**: they state the expected behavior, the success thresholds (e.g., % coverage, time-boxing, retention), and the artifacts that prove it (Excel file). They align to the BRD, map to UAT test cases, and support audit/compliance (ISO 27001, NIS2, GDPR, DORA).
