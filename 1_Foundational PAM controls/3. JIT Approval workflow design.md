# JIT Approval Workflow Design (BR-02)

**Objective**  
Replace permanent elevated rights and e-mail approvals with a mandatory, auditable, time-boxed dual-approval workflow.

**My role** : I designed the workflow, wrote the business rules, and got it signed off by CISO + Head of Infrastructure.

**Key Design Decisions (validated in 2 workshops)**
| Rule                                 | Decision (Wave 1)                                 | Reason / Compliance |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Approval type                        | **Dual control** – Business Owner + Technical Owner | DORA Art.25 / NIS2 |
| Maximum session duration              | 8 hours (default 4 h)                              | Zero standing privilege |
| Mandatory justification               | Yes – free text + ticket reference (ticket/incident) | Audit trail |
| Escalation if no answer              | 30 min → auto-escalate to backup approver          | SLA operational |
| Automatic revocation                 | At expiry or manual “kill switch” by SOC          | Real-time risk reduction |

**BPMN TO BE** → `[diagrams/jit_dual_approval_bpmn_to_be.png](..4_Documents%20&%20diagrams/`  
**AS IS (before)** → Informal e-mail threads → no trace, no time limit → 0 % audited

**Configuration in CyberArk**
- Master Policy → “Require approval for account use”  
- Safe-level → “Require dual control” + list of approvers (from BR-00 ownership matrix)  
- PVWA → Self-service request form with mandatory reason field

**Result Wave 1**  
- 93 % of privileged sessions via JIT  
- Average approval time: 11 min  
- Zero permanent admin rights remaining
