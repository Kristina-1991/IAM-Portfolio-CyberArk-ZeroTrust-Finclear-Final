# Semi-Automated Onboarding after Discovery Scan (BR-01)

**Objective**  
Replace the previous 3-day manual onboarding (20 % error rate) with a **semi-automated, owner-driven, risk-based process** that achieves:  
- ≤ 4 hours average onboarding time  
- 0 shared/orphan accounts imported into production Safes  
- 100 % of onboarded accounts have confirmed Business + Technical Owner  
- Full audit trail from discovery → storage → first rotation

**My role – IAM Senior Business Analyst**  
I defined the business rules, acceptance criteria and governance model.  
I co-led the design workshops with the PAM Operations team and got final sign-off from CISO + Head of Infrastructure (15 Oct 2025).

### Key Design Decisions – Wave 1 (validated & signed-off)

| Decision                                   | Choice (Wave 1)                                     | Business / Compliance Reason                              |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Discovery frequency                        | **Daily scheduled scan** (00:30)                    | Catch new privileged accounts within 24 h                  |
| Pending Accounts location                  | **Dedicated “Pending” Safe** (read-only for PAM Ops)| Clear separation – no risk of accidental production import |
| Human verification                         | **Mandatory before any bulk onboard**               | Semi-automated = always a human in the loop (Zero Trust)   |
| Owner confirmation workflow                | ServiceNow ticket → Application Owner → 5-day SLA   | Guarantees ownership (BR-00 matrix) before onboarding      |
| Auto-accept criteria                       | Known owner + naming convention + platform match    | 95 %+ accounts auto-validated → only exceptions reviewed  |
| Quarantine for unknown / rejected         | **Automatic move to Quarantine Safe** + CISO alert  | No orphan ever reaches production                          |
| Safe assignment                            | **Rule-based** (naming convention → Safe mapping)   | Consistent, repeatable, auditable                          |
| First rotation                             | **Automatic immediately after onboarding**          | No credential exposure – password never known by human    |
| Fallback when DNA unavailable              | Full manual “Add Account” path (documented)         | Business continuity guaranteed                             |


### BPMN AS IS

### BPMN token simulation:

To try the interactive the BPMN simulation : 

1. Download the BPMN file : [Onboarding of privileged accounts](../4_Documents%20&%20diagrams/Onboarding_privileged_accounts_ASIS.bpmn)
2. Open this simulator : https://bpmn-io.github.io/bpmn-js-token-simulation/modeler.html
3. Drag and drop the BPMN file
4. Click on "token simulation"
5. Click on the "trigger event" 

### BPMN TO BE

### Implementation in CyberArk 

### Result Wave 1 – December 2025
- 96.8 % accounts onboarded semi-automatically  
- Average time discovery → secured : **3 h 12 min**  
- 0 shared/orphan accounts in production Safes  
- 100 % accounts have named Business + Technical Owner

**Evidence**  

- Onboarding rules catalogue → `evidence/onboarding_rules_catalogue.xlsx`  
- Workshop sign-off (CISO) → `evidence/br01_design_signoff.pdf`

**This design is now the official onboarding standard for all future waves (including OT/SCADA pilot).**
