# Wave 2 – Full Cloud + OT/SCADA Pilot (Weeks 5–14)

**Business Owner** : Head of Cloud Architecture + OT Manager  
**Go-live target** : December 2025

### Scope combiné
| Domaine                  | Comptes / Devices | Priorité |
|--------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| AWS root & power users   | ~80               | High     |
| Azure subscription owners + PIM | ~70            | High     |
| Break-glass cloud        | 10                | High     |
| **OT/SCADA pilot**       | 250 devices (Siemens/Rockwell) | Pilot (air-gapped) |

### Key Backlog Items (combined)

| Item                                      | Points | DoD                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Deploy AWS & Azure connectors              | 13     | 20 test accounts rotated                       |
| Deploy custom OT/SCADA connectors         | 15     | 50 highest-risk devices discovered            |
| Create cloud + OT-specific Safes           | 8      | Naming convention + JIT mandatory             |
| JIT for cloud consoles (max 4 h)          | 13     | Dual approval + reason mandatory              |
| JIT pilot for OT devices (max 2 h)         | 10     | Tested on 20 devices                          |
| Session recording (HTML5 cloud + air-gapped OT) | 12 | 100 % recorded + Splunk export (cloud)       |
| Auto-revocation on termination (SailPoint) | 10    | Tested with fake leavers                      |

### Readiness Checks (tous PASS avant go-live)

| Check                                      | Owner             | Status |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| AWS & Azure connectors live                 | Cloud team        | Green  |
| OT/SCADA restricted DNA agent deployed     | OT team           | Green  |
| Air-gapped PSM instance ready              | CyberArk SME      | Green  |
| Emergency break-glass procedure documented  | CISO              | Green  |

### Outcome Wave 2
- No permanent cloud root access → full JIT coverage  
- OT/SCADA pilot 100 % successful → Go decision for full rollout Q2 2026  
- All controls identical to Wave 1 (recording, JIT, rotation) → same KPI targets achieved
