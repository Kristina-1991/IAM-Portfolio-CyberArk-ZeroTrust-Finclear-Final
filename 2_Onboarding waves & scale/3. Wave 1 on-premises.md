|----------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Configure Windows/Unix platforms | 8            | Connectors tested + 10 sample accounts onboarded        |
| Create & lock 5 production Safes | 5            | Naming convention + dual control + SoD rules applied    |
| Bulk onboarding domain admins    | 13           | ≥ 98 % success, 0 shared/orphan                         |
| Dual approval+ JIT for local admins | 13       | Workflow live, average approval < 15 min                |
| Full session recording via PSM   | 8            | 100 % sessions recorded + visible in Splunk            |
| Hypercare runbook + 24/7 on-call | 5            | Runbook signed-off                                      |
