# 3. Onboarding Waves & Scale Strategy
**Objective**  
Execute a risk-based, business-prioritised rollout of privileged accounts into CyberArk, achieving ≥ 95 % coverage of critical assets within 14 weeks while maintaining zero production impact.

**Approach (what I delivered as IAM Business Analyst)**  
- Leveraged BR-00 deliverables (inventory, ownership matrix, SoD matrix, data quality report)  
- Ran two prioritisation workshops with CISO, Head of Cloud, Compliance and Application Owners  
- Defined waves using the criteria: **Business impact × Vulnerability exposure × Implementation effort**  
- Built detailed wave content, success criteria and rollback plan

### Onboarding Waves – Final v1.1 (signed-off December 2025)

| Wave | Timeline      | Scope (examples)                                    | # Accounts (approx.) | Success Criteria                              | Business Owner sign-off |
|------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Wave 0** | Pre-week 1   | Quarantine Safe for all orphan/shared/generic accounts identified in BR-00 | 120                  | 100 % moved out of production Safes           | CISO                    |
| **Wave 1** | Weeks 1–4    | On-premise critical systems<br>• Windows/Unix domain admins<br>• Local admins on trading & finance servers<br>• Service accounts with high privileges | 180                  | ≥ 98 % onboarded<br>0 shared/orphan in prod<br>UAT signed-off | Head of Infrastructure + Head of Finance |
| **Wave 2** | Weeks 5–8    | Databases & core applications<br>• Oracle, SQL Server (trading & risk)<br>• Critical SaaS (M365 admin, Salesforce) | 220                  | 100 % sessions via PSM<br>Recording verified in Splunk | Head of DB + Application Owners |
| **Wave 3** | Weeks 9–12   | Cloud consoles & automation<br>• AWS root & power users<br>• Azure subscription owners<br>• Entra ID / SailPoint sync for termination events | 150                  | JIT workflow live<br>Auto-revocation on termination tested | Head of Cloud Architecture |
| **Wave 4** | Weeks 13–14  | Remaining + SCADA pilot<br>• Legacy systems<br>• OT/SCADA pilot (250 devices) | 80 + pilot           | Full coverage report<br>Pilot lessons learned documented | CISO + OT Manager |

### Prioritisation Matrix (used in workshops)

| Priority | Criteria                                          | Examples                              |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| High     | Business impact ≥ €5M or regulatory finding risk | Trading servers, AWS root, Domain Admins |
| Medium   | Recent activity + no owner                        | Orphan DB accounts with logins < 90d  |
| Low      | Legacy, low risk                                  | Old test accounts                     |

### Risk Mitigation & Governance
- Weekly wave review with steering committee  
- Rollback plan per wave (48h revert possible)  
- Daily Splunk monitoring dashboard (onboarding success rate, failed jobs)  
- Hypercare team 24/7 for Wave 1 & 2  
- Go/No-Go gate before each wave (requires CISO + Business Owner sign-off)

**Outcome**  
- 95 % of critical privileged accounts secured in 12 weeks  
- Zero production incidents during rollout  
- Foundation laid for future automation (SailPoint ↔ CyberArk sync, SCADA full rollout)
