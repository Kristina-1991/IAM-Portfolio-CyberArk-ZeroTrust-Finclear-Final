**Result** : 100 % of stories delivered on time – zero production incidents – final CISO sign-off.

### 2. Environment Readiness Checks – Mandatory Gate before UAT

All eight checks were executed and evidenced before starting UAT.  
Any FAIL would have blocked testing.

**Go/No-Go decision** : 8/8 PASS → UAT authorised on 15 Oct 2025.

# UAT Plan & Execution – Final Closure Report  
**Programme** : FinClear – CyberArk Privileged Access Management (2025)  
**Execution window** : 14–18 October 2025  
**My role** : UAT Coordinator, Test Designer & Evidence Owner

### Business Analyst Perspective – Why this UAT was exceptional
The UAT phase (TU01–TU12) was the ultimate validation that the implemented solution fully supports the organisation’s Zero Trust maturity and regulatory obligations (ISO 27001 A.8.x, NIS2, DORA, GDPR).

The 12 test scenarios replicated real business workflows across the entire privileged access lifecycle:
- Discovery & semi-automated onboarding (including orphan cleanup and IGA/AD sync)  
- Just-In-Time elevation with mandatory dual-control approval and auto-revocation  
- 100 % PSM-proxied session recording, playback and real-time Splunk correlation  
- Self-service experience and notification workflows for end-users and approvers  

Every test case was directly traceable to Acceptance Criteria defined in BR-01 / BR-02 / BR-03.  
Result: **100 % Pass** – no severity 1–2 defects – all business owners signed off.

This UAT provided measurable evidence that the platform is operationally sustainable and ready for transition to Business-as-Usual (BAU).
